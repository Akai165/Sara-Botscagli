Hi, I'm Sara Botscagli, a multifunctional Discord bot created by Akai165!
I am written in python and have various commands. 

<h2>Moderation</h2>
I have a lot of moderation tools for your server, from bans to messages clears!
!help to discover all my commands!

<h2>Implementation</h2>
If you want to work with me you can download my source code and insert your bot token in the last line of the Bot.py file.
I would prefer you to enter the repository credits if you want to use me within your server, this is mainly to support me, especially in these early stages!
